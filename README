BBRC descriptors are calculated repeatedly on bootstrap samples of a dataset, which is feasible due to the inherent efficiency of BBRC mining.
Each sample is processed passed through the BBRC webservice architecture. The server is loaded with several jobs in parallel, which increases performance.
A probabilistic chi-square test is performed on the most frequently sampled descriptors (patterns) using a poisson MLE estimate.
Patterns suriviving the test are mapped back on the database molecules, using a parallelized version of molecular fragment matching.
